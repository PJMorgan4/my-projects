    <h2>Scratch Game</h2>

    <p>We made a team project with the theme of Marvel. We had two weeks to create an entirely new quest game with more rooms and add-ons. The game takes Deadpool on a journey through time as he tries to return to the present. You can go to various points in time and beat different challenges. The hardest part was transferring pictures, code, and sprites from one teammate's computer to another. Another challenge was the time. I definitely felt the pressure at the end to finish with a tight deadline. In the end I think it was a good experience because it taught me how the basics of code work.</p>

    <p>Using Python CMU's collaborative task feature. our group worked on creating a portrait to represent oursleves. I personally worked on the squirrel with the hoodie. I struggled with the face of the squirrel and the lack of tools usually available in digital drawing apps. I now know functions that would've helped me draw my squirrel much easier and less creepy.</p>
